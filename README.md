# Drive-Through Time Analysis Repository

This GitHub repository contains an analysis of drive-through times for Restaurant X and Restaurant Y. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive overview of the data analysis process, including data collection, summary statistics, data visualization, and the calculation of confidence intervals for the mean drive-through service times.

## Contents

- **Datasets**: This repository includes two datasets, one for Restaurant X and another for Restaurant Y. These datasets contain drive-through service time data. These datasets contain randomly generated data.

- **Code File**: The code file (drive_times_analysis.ipynb) contains the complete analysis of the drive-through times for both restaurants. It includes data processing, summary statistics calculation, data visualization, and confidence interval calculation.

## Analysis Process

The analysis in this repository will follow the following steps:

1. Data Collection: We will provide links to the datasets for Restaurant X and Restaurant Y.

2. Summary Statistics: The code will calculate various summary statistics for each dataset, including the mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, maximum, and minimum.

3. Data Visualization: We will create visual representations of the data using boxplots to describe the distribution of drive-through service times for both restaurants.

4. Confidence Intervals: The code will calculate both 99% and 90% confidence intervals for the mean drive-through service times for each restaurant.

Please note that this README.md file provides an overview of the analysis process, and the detailed analysis can be found in the code file within this repository.
